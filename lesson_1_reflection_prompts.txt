How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   i can see the diffrence more easily casue viewing the diff comparing the files line by line of diffrence

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    i can see all the changes that i made and can go back to the last versions of my code if something goes wrong

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   manually choosing to commit has a downfall of human mistakes for example if you forogot to commit ur code before turning off the pc or committing all the time hence making the log big and messy
   and when you commit correctly your changelog of the code will be easier to understand 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

cause git is built for coding and in coding u can work on diffrent files and group them up together to make a project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

i can use the command git log to see the changelog of the commits on the file and with git diff i can choose two commits that are close to eachother to see the diffrence between them by using git diff FirstId SecondId


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

i can go to my last version and checkout what happend wrong when i changed my code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    making a repo
